                <p>At a high level, digital marketing refers to advertising delivered through digital channels such as
                    search engines, websites, social media, email, and mobile apps. Using these online media channels,
                    digital marketing is the method by which companies endorse goods, services, and brands. Consumers
                    heavily rely on digital means to research products. For example, Think with Google marketing
                    insights found that 48% of consumers start their inquiries on search engines, while 33% look to
                    brand websites and 26% search within mobile applications.</p>
                <p>
                    While modern day digital marketing is an enormous system of channels to which marketers simply must
                    onboard their brands, advertising online is much more complex than the channels alone. In order to
                    achieve the true potential of digital marketing, marketers have to dig deep into today’s vast and
                    intricate cross-channel world to discover strategies that make an impact through engagement
                    marketing. Engagement marketing is the method of forming meaningful interactions with potential and
                    returning customers based on the data you collect over time. By engaging customers in a digital
                    landscape, you build brand awareness, set yourself as an industry thought leader, and place your
                    business at the forefront when the customer is ready to buy.

                    <p>As a digital marketing expert company, we have been using Facebook advertising for our clients’
                        businesses for several years. we always go back to Facebook because the platform has very
                        granular targeting to find your ideal target market. No other marketing platform allows for such
                        in-depth capabilities as Facebook. Plus, Facebook is constantly making improvements to have a
                        better user experience.</p>

                <div id="content">
                    <p>We like Linkedin for B2B advertising because we can customize the ad and make it highly targeted
                        to a buyer personal . What makes Linkedin unique is that you can target the ad to people’s
                        profession instead of simply what they like on Facebook. This helps B2B companies stay top of
                        mind to the executives they are aiming to.</p>

                    <p>We have received a high volume of qualified leads through Quora as they tend to be great,
                        top-of-the-funnel leads at a great price. When combined with remarketing through Facebook and
                        Google, it’s a great way to fill the top of the funnel with inexpensive leads, and then push
                        them down the funnel through remarketing.</p>

                        Many platforms don’t play well together for attribution. Google has unified audience targeting
                        across their stack of products from search display to video so you can understand every customer
                        touch-point and apply the different tactics within the platform.</p>

                    <p>Instagram has made its way to be the best advertising platform for sales. It’s all about
                        influence and marketing. If you know who your audience is and there is a product/market fit,
                        then Instagram will help you target that audience and increase your engagement, unlike any other
                        platform. The other platforms require huge ad budgets and give you very little in return.</p>
